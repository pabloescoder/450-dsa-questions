Count sorted vowel strings (problem)
Given an integer n, return the number of strings of length n that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted. A string s is lexicographically sorted if each character comes before or same as the next one in the alphabet.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2

Output: 15

Explanation: sorted vowel strings of size 2 are:

aa, ae, ai, ao, au, ea, ee, ei, eo, eu, ii, io, iu, oo, ou, uu

Example 2:

Input: n = 9

Output: 715

Constraints:

n >= 1
