Longest common subsequence (problem)
Given two strings s1 and s2, find the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string s is a subset of its characters that are not necessarily adjacent but have to be in the right order.

Example:

input:
s1 = "abdacbab"
s2 = "acebfca"

output: 4

explanation: A possible longest common subsequence of s1 and s2 is "abca"
