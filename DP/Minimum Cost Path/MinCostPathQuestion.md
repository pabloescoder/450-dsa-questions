Given a cost matrix cost[][] and a position (M, N) in cost[][], 
write a function that returns cost of minimum cost path to reach (M, N) from (0, 0). 
Each cell of the matrix represents a cost to traverse through that cell. 
The total cost of a path to reach (M, N) is the sum of all the costs on that path (including both source and destination). 
You can only traverse down or right from a given cell. 
i.e., from a given cell (i, j), cells (i+1, j) and (i, j+1) can be traversed.

Note: You may assume that all costs are positive integers.
